no basic sets
no constraints per equality / inequality

meta_runner.py
* refactor coverage logging and file locations
* add more statistics logging (e.g. empty sets)

set_meta_tester.cpp
* further integrate with ApiFuzzer (e.g. random int generation)

api_fuzzer.cpp
* intersperse generation with metamorphic testing
* merge ApiFuzzerNew with ApiFuzzer
* fuzz input sets as requested by the set_meta_tester
* get rid of hardcoded variable names (i.e. link output variable name from
fuzzer to input variables of meta tester)

api_elements.cpp
* finish ApiExpr definition and replace the hardcoded linear expression
generation hack

test_emitter.cpp
