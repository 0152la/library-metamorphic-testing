* change specification fields as decided with Ally a while ago
* add pointer type support to fuzzer
* add variable declaration support to fuzzer
* add primitive type support to meta tester
* move to using smart pointers and move semantics throughout

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

no basic sets
no constraints per equality / inequality

set_meta_tester.cpp
* further integrate with ApiFuzzer (e.g. random int generation)

api_fuzzer.cpp
* intersperse generation with metamorphic testing
* merge ApiFuzzerNew with ApiFuzzer

api_elements.cpp
* finish ApiExpr definition and replace the hardcoded linear expression
generation hack

test_emitter.cpp
* move paths to config file
